### wetSlip is a MERN_stack booking app that allows owners of docks to host them for users to rent. This can be done by location, length required, draft required, and date.

## User Story:

### Host:
As a host, the host will be able to register, login and create a card that displays their dock with the following search parameters:
Price, Dates available, Dock location, Dock length, and Water depth (min draft required by vessel).

A host will be able to upload photos (max and min numbers not yet determined), a description, and price of their dock/slip.

### User:
As a captain (user), will be able to register, login and search for available docks/slips created by the applications host. Captains will be able to search for availability be the parameters defined by the host.

### Goal:
My goal utilize sockets.io to create a messaging feature between host and captain.

### MVP:
Application the allows host to host their dock, and a captain to reserve it by date, with an automatic confirmation send to both host and captain.
